## 🏗️ **Universal Architecture Patterns**

### **Enterprise Hook Pattern**
```typescript
export function useEnterpriseFeature() {
  const services = useFeatureServices();
  
  return {
    // State management
    data: null,
    isLoading: false,
    error: null,
    
    // Actions
    fetchData: async () => { /* enterprise implementation */ },
    updateData: async () => { /* enterprise implementation */ },
    
    // Advanced features
    realTimeEnabled: false,
    cacheHitRate: 0,
    performanceMetrics: {}
  };
}
```

### **Migration Hook Pattern**
```typescript
export function useFeatureMigration(config) {
  const enterpriseHook = useEnterpriseFeature();
  const legacyHook = useLegacyFeature();
  
  return {
    // Automatic migration based on configuration
    ...shouldUseEnterprise ? enterpriseHook : legacyHook,
    migration: {
      isUsingEnterprise: true,
      errors: [],
      performance: {},
      config
    }
  };
}
```

### **Service Layer Pattern**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class FeatureService {
  constructor(dataService: DataService) {}
  
  async createWithValidation(data: Data): Promise<Result> {
    // Business validation
    // Service orchestration
    // Event logging
  }
}
```
